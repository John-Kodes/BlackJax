# BlackJax

A recreation of the game "BlackJack" in a web browser experience. Made with React.js. I wanted to use my newly gained knowledge of React, Router, Redux, Styled-Components, Framer-Motion and also using the LocalStorage, into practice while also show casing my design and creative skills. I wanted this project to be original and engaging for the user so i decided to create a card game that i, myself enjoy playing.

This was a wonderful opportunity for me to get comfortable with and really hammer down what I learnt, especially Redux.

The goal of the game is to have your hand be closer to 21 than the dealer. But going over it will make you lose instantly. Although, if you get an Ace and a 10 value card, that's called a BlackJack and you may win +50% extra of your original bet if the dealer cannot get 21 as well.

As a small challenge, try to earn \$20 000! No need to worry about closing the browser and loading progress as the game keeps tracks of your progress :)

## Lessons Learned

With this project, I really wanted to be knowledgeable in 2 things, Redux and the React Hooks. I extensively read through the official Redux documentation and also used the Redux Toolkit library they suggested. It took some time to learn but it was well worth it and I am now confident in using the Redux Toolkit.

I learnt more about the React Hooks through their official documentation but I also read multiple articles and some videos explaining more about how it works, and how to implement it.

This project also really made me feel more comfortable with using Figma, which helped greatly in creating a mock up design for the websites but also in creating SVG icons and art to use in the background. I avoided using images so that the art would be rendered almost immediately and also greatly reduce file size.

## Potential Future Features/Updates

- Create a leaderboard system that shows a list of players and their high scores. But will only be posted when the player "cash out"

- Create an interactive tutorial on how to play the game for first time players.

- Create a "True Count Counter" feature which calculates the true count of the game. True Count in BlackJack tells the player what their advantage is at any point in a multiple deck BlackJack game. The higher the count, the greater the chances the player has to win.
