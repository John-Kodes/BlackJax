# BlackJax

A recreation of the game "BlackJack" in a web browser experience. Made with React.js. I wanted to use my newly gained knowledge of React, Router, Redux, Styled-Components, Framer-Motion and also using the LocalStorage, into practice while also show casing my design and creative skills. I wanted this project to be original and engaging for the user so i decided to create a card game that i, myself enjoy playing.

This was a wonderful opportunity for me to get comfortable with and really hammer down what I learnt, especially Redux.

The goal of the game is to have your hand be closer to 21 than the dealer. But going over it will make you lose instantly. Although, if you get an Ace and a 10 value card, that's called a BlackJack and you may win +50% extra of your original bet if the dealer cannot get 21 as well.

As a small challenge, try to earn \$20 000! No need to worry about closing the browser and loading progress as the game keeps tracks of your progress :)
